Shrivel
=======

Shrivel is both a minification (but not obfuscation) tool and Go library.

Currently, shrivel supports SQL.

In order to install shrivel, it is easy to build from source like so:

    git clone https://github.com/jordanocokoljic/shrivel
    cd shrivel
    go build ./cmd/shrivel

Then copy the compiled executable somewhere it can be found on PATH.
